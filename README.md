# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Topics that students learn before bootcamp starts.

This project was used to prepare me for topics that will be used frequently during the coding bootcamp and provide guidance for others that are interested in doing the same. I wanted to build this project to have an organized workspace for topics that are common in web development. If I needed to refer back to what I learned or add topics, I can while helping others as well.
